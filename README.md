# Essign

> To bear and not to own;  
to act and not lay claim;  
to do the work and let it go:  
for just letting it go  
is what makes it stay.  

This is a simplified version of [Signature Economies](https://github.com/kernel-community/signature-economies) which enables anyone to highlight some text and mint it as an NFT, effectively signing the part that most resonates with them

> To have without possessing,  
do without claiming,  
lead without controlling:  
this is mysterious power.
